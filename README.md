## Projects using ESP32S and C from absolute beginning
#### I have few years of arduino backround, but i wanted to do something more "useful" which would help me towards embedded systems engineer career. So i decided to start doing basic projects using just C and ESP-IDF. 
#### If you want to try using these C programs run them in PlarformIO.
