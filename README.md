### Projects using ESP32S and C from absolute beginning
##### - All the comments in the C files are mostly useless, but for the sake of my understanding they are there. And yeah they might not be 100% correct!
##### - I have few years of arduino backround, but i wanted to do something more "useful" which would help me towards embedded systems engineer career. So i decided to start doing basic projects using just C and ESP-IDF. 
##### - If you want to try using these C programs run them in PlarformIO.
